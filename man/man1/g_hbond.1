.SH DESCRIPTION
g_hbond computes and analyzes hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are
determined based on cutoffs for the angle Donor - Hydrogen - Acceptor
(zero is extended) and the distance Hydrogen - Acceptor.
OH and NH groups are regarded as donors, O is an acceptor always,
N is an acceptor by default, but this can be switched using

.B -nitacc
. Dummy hydrogen atoms are assumed to be connected
to the first preceding non-hydrogen atom.


You need to specify two groups for analysis, which must be either
identical or non-overlapping. All hydrogen bonds between the two
groups are analyzed.


If you set -shell, you will be asked for an additional index group
which should contain exactly one atom. In this case, only hydrogen
bonds between atoms within the shell distance from the one atom are
considered.

It is also possible to analyse specific hydrogen bonds with

.B -sel
. This index file must contain a group of atom triplets
Donor Hydrogen Acceptor, in the following way:



.B 
[ selected ]

     20    21    24

     25    26    29

      1     3     6




Note that the triplets need not be on separate lines.
Each atom triplet specifies a hydrogen bond to be analyzed,
note also that no check is made for the types of atoms.



.B -ins
turns on computing solvent insertion into hydrogen bonds.
In this case an additional group must be selected, specifying the
solvent molecules.



.B Output:



.B -num
:  number of hydrogen bonds as a function of time.


.B -ac
:   average over all autocorrelations of the existence
functions (either 0 or 1) of all hydrogen bonds.


.B -dist
: distance distribution of all hydrogen bonds.


.B -ang
:  angle distribution of all hydrogen bonds.


.B -hx
:   the number of n-n+i hydrogen bonds as a function of time
where n and n+i stand for residue numbers and i ranges from 0 to 6.
This includes the n-n+3, n-n+4 and n-n+5 hydrogen bonds associated
with helices in proteins.


.B -hbn
:  all selected groups, donors, hydrogens and acceptors
for selected groups, all hydrogen bonded atoms from all groups and
all solvent atoms involved in insertion.


.B -hbm
:  existence matrix for all hydrogen bonds over all
frames, this also contains information on solvent insertion
into hydrogen bonds. Ordering is identical to that in 
.B -hbn

index file.


.B -dan
: write out the number of donors and acceptors analyzed for
each timeframe. This is especially usefull when using 
.B -shell
.



Note: options 
.B -ac
, 
.B -life
, 
.B -hbn
and 
.B -hbm

require an amount of memory proportional to the total numbers of donors
times the total number of acceptors in the selected group(s).
